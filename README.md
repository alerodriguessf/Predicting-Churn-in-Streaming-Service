## Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical metric for streaming services. This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to predict churn based on user behavior, demographics, and platform usage data.

The project workflow includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Logistic Regression Modeling
- Random Forest Modeling
- Hyperparameter Tuning with Grid Search
- Model Evaluation and Comparison

## Features
- Predict churn probability for individual users.
- Compare performance metrics for logistic regression and random forest models.
- Visualize correlations, outliers, and feature importance.
- Evaluate model performance using confusion matrices and classification reports.

## Data Workflow
1. **Data Understanding:** 
   - Dataset inspection and profiling.
   - Identification of missing values and outliers.

2. **Data Preparation:** 
   - Filling missing values.
   - Data transformation (scaling, encoding).
   - Feature engineering.

3. **Modeling:**
   - Logistic regression and random forest models.
   - Hyperparameter optimization using Grid Search.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Confusion matrix and classification metrics.
   - Visualization of predictions and probabilities.
